Download YouTube Videos Easily with Python

I recently wrote a simple Python GUI for downloading YouTube videos using the pytube library. It's easy to use and can be customized to meet your specific needs.

To download a video, simply enter the URL of the video in the text box and click the "DOWNLOAD" button. The GUI will take care of the rest.



If you have any feedback or suggestions, please let me know in the comments below.
